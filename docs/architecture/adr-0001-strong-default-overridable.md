# ADR-0001: Strong Default, Overridable Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This repository is a reusable school-os for multiple future projects. It needs:

- strong defaults to keep solo/open-source delivery consistent
- clear quality gates for reliability
- explicit mechanisms to override defaults per project

## Decision

Adopt a strong baseline architecture with automated guardrails, and allow project-level
overrides via documented exception paths.

### Baseline rules

- Keep app-specific logic in `apps/*` and shared logic in `packages/*`.
- Expose module boundaries through public entrypoints.
- Avoid deep internal imports across module boundaries.
- Enforce boundaries with scripts and CI gates.

### Override model

- Overrides are allowed with written rationale in `docs/overrides.md`.
- A project may add its own `ARCHITECTURE.md` and stricter rules.
- Overrides should be additive where possible to preserve school-os compatibility.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Better maintainability and onboarding.
- Reduced architectural drift across projects.
- Faster confidence in refactors due to boundaries and tests.

### Negative

- Initial setup and rule maintenance overhead.
- Some flexibility cost when prototyping quickly.

## Follow-up

- Keep architecture checks versioned and lightweight.
- Revisit boundary rules when adding new apps or package categories.
