# Architecture Overrides

Use this file to record intentional deviations from starter defaults.

## Why this exists

The starter is intentionally opinionated, but not rigid. Overrides are valid when they
enable a better fit for a specific project requirement.

## How to override safely

1. Document the override in this file.
2. Explain why the default is insufficient.
3. Describe risks and rollback strategy.
4. Add or update tests to protect the new behavior.
5. If needed, add project-local rules in `<project>/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Override template

```md
### Override: <name>
- **Scope:** <app/package/path>
- **Default being overridden:** <rule>
- **Reason:** <why this project needs it>
- **Risk:** <trade-offs>
- **Mitigation:** <tests/checks/docs>
- **Owner:** <name>
- **Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
```
