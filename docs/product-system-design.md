# School OS Product System Design

Last updated: 2026-05-21

Status: working architecture blueprint. This is the target design for turning the current
school-os monorepo into the product described in the portfolio/spec notes: a mobile-first trust
engine for schools, starting with smart attendance and growing into an AI-first operating system.

## Executive Direction

School OS should be built as a secure modular monolith first, with event-driven seams and clear
module boundaries, then split into independent services only when load, team ownership, or
compliance pressure justifies it.

The highest-value product loop is:

```text
Student arrives -> attendance event -> parent alert -> live dashboard -> AI risk/update signal
```

The safest engineering loop is:

```text
Write source-of-truth change in Postgres
-> write outbox event in same transaction
-> worker delivers notifications, realtime updates, AI jobs, and analytics
-> every side effect is idempotent and auditable
```

Day one should not run Postgres, MySQL, Kafka, Redis, multiple API frameworks, and AI services as
equal peers. That would add distributed-system cost before the product has stable workflows. The
best initial production stack is:

- Next.js web dashboard.
- Expo mobile app for parents, teachers, guards, and bus conductors.
- Hono API as the primary product API.
- Postgres as the only source-of-truth database.
- Redis for cache, rate limits, short-lived locks, and lightweight queues.
- A worker process for outbox delivery, scheduled jobs, reminders, and AI pipelines.
- S3-compatible object storage for files, report cards, receipts, and media.
- Optional FastAPI AI service once model workflows need Python ML libraries.
- Kafka or Redpanda later, only after multiple independent consumers need durable event streams.

## Product Boundaries

School OS is not a full ERP, LMS content marketplace, social network, or accounting system. It is a
school trust, communication, attendance, operations, finance, and intelligence platform.

Primary personas:

| Persona | Primary surface | Core need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| School owner/principal | Web dashboard, mobile summaries | Trust, admissions, finance, risk visibility |
| Admin staff | Web dashboard | Fees, admissions, documents, parent follow-ups |
| Teacher | Mobile first, web secondary | Attendance, homework, grading, parent communication |
| Gate guard | Mobile scanner | Fast and reliable arrival/departure scan |
| Bus conductor | Mobile scanner + GPS | Bus check-in/out and route safety |
| Parent/guardian | Mobile app + WhatsApp | Child safety, homework, fees, communication |
| Student | Mobile/web later | Timetable, homework, feedback |

## Service Design

### Stage 1: MVP Production Services

| Runtime | Repo location | Responsibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web app | `apps/web` | Principal/admin/teacher web workflows | Keep route composition in `src/app`, feature UI in `src/modules` |
| Mobile app | `apps/mobile` | Parent, teacher, guard, bus workflows | Use role-specific route groups and secure token storage |
| Product API | `apps/hono-api` | Auth, tenancy, domain APIs, webhooks | Primary backend for production |
| Worker | `apps/hono-api/src/workers` | Outbox, reminders, notification dispatch, AI jobs | Same codebase at first to avoid a premature service split |
| Docs app | `apps/docs` | Internal/product docs | Publish architecture and API docs here later |
| Postgres | Docker/cloud managed | Primary data store | Tenant-scoped relational source of truth |
| Redis | Docker/cloud managed | Cache, rate limit, locks, queue buffer | Never source of truth for business records |
| Object storage | S3/R2 | Files, PDFs, media | Private buckets, signed URLs only |

### Stage 2: Services To Split Only When Needed

| Service | When to split | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI service | Python ML/RAG workflows become non-trivial | Feature computation, model calls, scoring, RAG, evals |
| Notification service | WhatsApp/SMS/email volume grows | Provider routing, retries, templates, delivery status |
| Realtime gateway | Live dashboard/bus tracking gets high traffic | WebSocket/SSE fanout |
| Analytics service | Reports affect API latency | Materialized rollups, cohort reports, BI exports |
| Import/integration service | Many schools import legacy data | CSV/Excel/SIS connectors, MySQL import adapters |

### Stage 3: Microservice Candidates

Only split after clear operational pressure:

- `identity-service`: users, sessions, memberships, roles, permissions.
- `attendance-service`: attendance sessions, scans, daily summaries.
- `communication-service`: announcements, chat, notification commands.
- `finance-service`: invoices, payments, ledger, receipts.
- `academics-service`: timetable, homework, assessments, report cards.
- `transport-service`: routes, trips, locations, bus attendance.
- `ai-intelligence-service`: student profiles, risk signals, actions, agent runs.

Until then, keep them as modules inside `apps/hono-api/src/modules`.

## Internal Communication

### Synchronous Calls

Use HTTP JSON for direct request/response flows:

- Browser/mobile -> Hono API.
- Hono API -> payment provider, WhatsApp provider, map provider, object storage.
- Hono API -> FastAPI AI service later, only through a typed internal client.

Rules:

- Every request has `x-request-id`.
- Authenticated requests derive `tenantId`, `userId`, and `role` from the session, not from the
  body.
- Service-to-service calls use service JWTs or mTLS once split.
- Public contracts use OpenAPI. TypeScript internal clients may use Hono RPC where useful.

### Asynchronous Events

Start with a transactional outbox table in Postgres:

```text
domain write + outbox_events insert in one transaction
worker polls pending outbox events
worker marks processing/sent/failed with retry count
consumer side effects use idempotency keys
```

This is enough for the MVP and protects against lost notifications without Kafka.

Add Kafka/Redpanda when all are true:

- More than two independent consumers need the same events.
- Replaying historical events becomes useful.
- Worker polling becomes a bottleneck.
- Analytics, AI, notification, and audit pipelines need independent scaling.

Kafka does not remove the need for idempotency. External APIs such as WhatsApp, SMS, email, and
payment providers are still at-least-once from our perspective.

## Database Strategy

### Primary Decision

Use Postgres as the only source-of-truth database.

Do not add MySQL as a second operational database for the core product. It increases migration,
query, backup, consistency, and team complexity without improving the MVP. Use MySQL only as an
integration target/source when a school or acquirer has legacy MySQL data.

Use Redis as cache and coordination, not as a database for records that must survive or be audited.

Use pgvector in Postgres for early AI/RAG search. Move to a dedicated vector database only if
Postgres vector indexes cannot meet recall, latency, memory, or filtering requirements.

### Tenancy Model

Use a shared Postgres database and shared tables with `tenant_id` on every tenant-owned table.

Why:

- Affordable private schools are small to mid-size.
- Shared tables simplify migrations and cross-tenant product analytics.
- Tenant isolation can be enforced with app authorization and Postgres row-level security.
- Enterprise isolation can still be offered later with dedicated DB/schema deployments.

Tenant rules:

- Every business table has `tenant_id`.
- Every query includes tenant scope at the repository layer.
- Postgres Row Level Security should be enabled for high-risk tables before production.
- `tenant_id` from the client body is ignored for authenticated writes.
- Cross-tenant admin access requires explicit platform role and audit trail.

### Shared Columns

Most tenant-owned tables should have:

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | UUID or stable text ID | Prefer one standard ID generator before production |
| `tenant_id` | UUID/text FK | Required for tenant-owned records |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Default now |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | Updated on mutation |
| `created_by` | user FK nullable | Null for system imports/jobs |
| `updated_by` | user FK nullable | Null for system imports/jobs |
| `deleted_at` | timestamptz nullable | Soft delete for business records |

Hard-delete only ephemeral records such as expired verification codes, sessions, temporary files,
and completed idempotency keys after retention.

## Core Database Tables

This is a product-level data model, not a final Prisma migration. Final schema should be added in
bounded modules with tests.

### Identity, Tenancy, And Authorization

| Table | Purpose | Key columns and constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenants` | One school organization or chain | `id`, `name`, `slug unique`, `status`, `timezone`, `default_locale` |
| `campuses` | Physical campuses under a tenant | `tenant_id`, `name`, `address`, `geo_lat`, `geo_lng` |
| `academic_years` | School year boundary | `tenant_id`, `name`, `starts_on`, `ends_on`, unique active year |

Authorization model:

- RBAC for coarse permissions.
- ABAC for record-level checks: teacher sees assigned sections, parent sees linked students,
  conductor sees assigned route, principal sees campus/tenant.
- Policy files live beside each module: `attendance.policy.ts`, `finance.policy.ts`, etc.

## API Route Design

Expose versioned product APIs under `/api/v1`. The current `/auth/*` Hono routes can remain during
transition, but new product routes should be versioned.

Response envelope:

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"code": 200,
	"message": "OK",
	"data": {},
	"requestId": "req_..."
}
```

Error envelope:

```json
{
	"success": false,
	"code": 400,
	"message": "Validation failed",
	"errorCode": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
	"errors": [{ "field": "email", "message": "Invalid email" }],
	"requestId": "req_..."
}
```

- Use path params only for identity, not filters.
- Use query params for filters: `?sectionId=&date=&status=`.
- Use commands for non-CRUD actions: `/approve`, `/reject`, `/generate`, `/share`.
- Every mutating route accepts an optional `Idempotency-Key` header.
- Pagination uses cursor-based pagination: `?limit=50&cursor=...`.

## Frontend And Mobile Route Map

### Next.js Web

Use App Router route groups:

```text
apps/web/src/app
+-- (public)
|   +-- page.tsx
|   +-- login/page.tsx
|   +-- register/page.tsx
+-- (dashboard)
|   +-- dashboard/page.tsx
|   +-- attendance/page.tsx
|   +-- students/page.tsx
|   +-- communication/page.tsx
|   +-- academics/page.tsx
|   +-- finance/page.tsx
|   +-- transport/page.tsx
|   +-- admissions/page.tsx
|   +-- ai-actions/page.tsx
|   +-- settings/page.tsx
+-- api/...
```

Next.js guidance from the installed docs supports route groups for organization without changing
URLs, route handlers for backend-for-frontend endpoints, and a dedicated data access layer for
server-side authorization and minimal DTOs. For School OS, use direct Hono API calls through a
small DAL/client and do not pass full database objects into client components.

### Expo Mobile

Use role-oriented route groups:

```text
apps/mobile/src/app
+-- (auth)/login.tsx
+-- (teacher)/home.tsx
+-- (teacher)/attendance-scan.tsx
+-- (teacher)/homework.tsx
+-- (parent)/home.tsx
+-- (parent)/children/[studentId].tsx
+-- (parent)/fees.tsx
+-- (parent)/messages.tsx
+-- (guard)/scan.tsx
+-- (bus)/trip.tsx
```

Mobile storage rules:

- Store refresh/session handles in `expo-secure-store`, not plain async storage.
- Do not treat device storage as the source of truth.
- Sync write actions through server idempotency keys.
- Queue offline scans locally with signed scan payloads and expire them quickly.

## Event And Kafka Design

### Domain Event Names

Use past-tense names for facts:

- `attendance.arrival_scanned.v1`
- `attendance.departure_scanned.v1`
- `attendance.absence_detected.v1`
- `notification.delivery_requested.v1`
- `notification.delivery_succeeded.v1`
- `finance.invoice_issued.v1`
- `finance.payment_received.v1`
- `academics.homework_assigned.v1`
- `transport.bus_location_recorded.v1`
- `ai.student_signal_created.v1`
- `ai.action_suggested.v1`
- `audit.security_event_recorded.v1`

Event envelope:

```json
{
	"eventId": "evt_...",
	"eventType": "attendance.arrival_scanned.v1",
	"occurredAt": "2026-05-21T09:00:00Z",
	"tenantId": "ten_...",
	"actor": { "type": "user", "id": "usr_..." },
	"aggregate": { "type": "student", "id": "stu_..." },
	"requestId": "req_...",
	"payload": {}
}
```

### Kafka Topics Later

If Kafka/Redpanda is introduced:

| Topic | Key | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `school.attendance.events.v1` | `tenantId:studentId` | notifications, AI, dashboards, audit |
| `school.notification.commands.v1` | `tenantId:recipientId` | notification service |
| `school.notification.deliveries.v1` | `tenantId:notificationId` | dashboard, audit, analytics |
| `school.finance.events.v1` | `tenantId:studentId` | receipts, AI, ledger analytics |
| `school.transport.locations.v1` | `tenantId:tripId` | realtime, ETA, parent app |
| `school.ai.actions.v1` | `tenantId:actionId` | approval queue, audit |
| `school.audit.events.v1` | `tenantId:resourceId` | immutable audit storage |

Partition by tenant plus aggregate when ordering matters. Keep consumers idempotent with unique
processed-event records.

## Cache, Queue, And Memory Strategy

Use cache-aside for read-heavy data:

| Cache key | TTL | Invalidated by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tenant:{tenantId}:settings` | 10 minutes | tenant updated |
| `user:{userId}:memberships` | 5 minutes | role/membership changed |
| `section:{sectionId}:students` | 5 minutes | enrollment changed |
| `attendance:{tenantId}:{date}:summary` | 30 seconds | attendance event |
| `timetable:{sectionId}:{week}` | 1 hour | timetable/substitution changed |
| `student:{studentId}:profile-summary` | 5 minutes | student/guardian/AI signal changed |

Rules:

- Do not cache payment mutation results as authority.
- Do not use write-behind for attendance, finance, or consent records.
- Use Redis locks only for short critical sections, not long business workflows.
- Use process memory only for static config, compiled templates, and permission maps with short TTLs.

## Core Algorithms

### QR Attendance

Use signed, rotating QR payloads:

```text
payload = tenantId + studentId + tokenId + expiresAt + nonce
signature = HMAC(payload, tenantAttendanceSecret)
```

Rules:

- QR tokens expire.
- Do not expose raw student IDs without signature.
- Scans are idempotent by `(session_id, student_id, direction, source_event_id)`.
- Late/absent classification is deterministic from bell schedule and grace period.

### Attendance State Machine

```text
unknown -> present
unknown -> absent
unknown -> late
present -> left_early
absent -> excused
any -> corrected, with approval/audit
```

Automated absence job:

```text
for each active attendance session after grace window:
  find enrolled students without present/late mark
  create absence_detected event
  create absence mark
  enqueue parent notification
  update daily summary
  create student signal if pattern threshold reached
```

### Bus ETA

Start simple:

- Haversine distance from current bus location to ordered stops.
- Rolling average speed by route segment.
- Geofence arrival/departure when bus enters/leaves stop radius.

Improve later:

- Map matching with provider APIs.
- Kalman smoothing for noisy GPS.
- Route-specific historical ETA model.

### Timetable Scheduling

Phase 1:

- Manual timetable editor.
- Deterministic conflict detection: teacher overlap, room overlap, section overlap, working hours.

Phase 2:

- Constraint solver such as OR-Tools CP-SAT for auto-scheduling.
- Hard constraints: teacher availability, class hours, room capacity, subject frequency.
- Soft constraints: avoid teacher overload, distribute hard subjects, minimize gaps.

### Student Intelligence Score

Start with explainable deterministic scoring, not black-box prediction.

Inputs:

- Attendance trend.
- Late frequency.
- Homework completion.
- Assessment trajectory.
- Concept mastery decline.
- Parent engagement.
- Fee stress signal, used carefully and never as an academic punishment.
- Behavior notes.

Output:

```json
{
	"studentId": "stu_...",
	"lifeScore": 84,
	"attendanceRisk": "medium",
	"learningRisk": "low",
	"parentEngagement": 72,
	"reasonCodes": [
		"absent_2_mondays_in_4_weeks",
		"math_score_declined_12_percent"
	],
	"confidence": 0.74
}
```

Principles:

- Show reason codes.
- Track score version.
- Allow human feedback.
- Monitor false positives.
- Do not use risk score as punishment or exclusion.

### Notification Routing

Algorithm:

```text
choose channel from priority + consent + parent preference + message urgency
dedupe by recipient + template + aggregate + time window
send through provider
retry with exponential backoff
fail over channel when allowed
record provider status
```

Priority order:

- Emergency: app push + WhatsApp + SMS, with admin confirmation.
- Attendance safety: WhatsApp first, SMS fallback.
- Finance: WhatsApp/email, payment link signed and expiring.
- General announcements: app push + WhatsApp/email based on preference.

### Parent Channel Preference

Phase 1:

- Rule-based preference from explicit settings and recent response history.

Phase 2:

- Thompson sampling or another conservative multi-armed bandit for send-time/channel choice.
- Optimize response probability, not pressure.
- Respect consent and quiet hours.

### AI And RAG

Use AI as a supervised assistant:

- Generate report card comments for teacher approval.
- Draft parent messages.
- Summarize daily/Friday briefings.
- Explain student risk signals.
- Generate homework/test variants from approved curriculum context.
- Answer parent questions only from tenant-approved knowledge.

Implementation:

- Use structured outputs for any AI result consumed by code.
- Use tenant-filtered retrieval from Postgres/pgvector.
- Store prompt versions and model versions.
- Run evals before changing prompts/models.
- Use human approval for high-risk actions.

RAG retrieval:

```text
query -> tenant filter -> vector search -> permission filter -> rerank -> answer with citations
```

Do not let AI tools call unrestricted product APIs. Each tool must have:

- A typed schema.
- Permission checks.
- Tenant scope.
- Rate limits.
- Audit logging.
- Dry-run mode for sensitive actions.

## Security And Privacy Design

School OS handles minors, location, attendance, education records, parent contact data, and payment
events. Treat it as high-sensitivity software from the start.

### Security Baseline

| Area | Required design |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | Passwords/passkeys, email verification, TOTP/WebAuthn for admins, session revocation |
| Password storage | Argon2id preferred or bcrypt with reviewed cost; breached password screening before production |
| Sessions | HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies; no production auth tokens in localStorage |
| CSRF | CSRF token or signed double-submit cookie plus origin/fetch metadata checks for cookie APIs |
| Authorization | RBAC + ABAC + object-level checks in every service method |
| Tenant isolation | Repository tenant scope plus Postgres RLS on high-risk tables |
| Input validation | Zod schemas at route boundary; reject unknown dangerous fields |
| Output filtering | DTOs only; never return raw ORM rows to clients |
| Rate limiting | Per IP, account, tenant, and route group |
| Security headers | CSP, frame denial, HSTS, no `x-powered-by`, strict CORS allowlist |
| Secrets | Environment/KMS, never checked in, rotated provider credentials |
| Files | Private object storage, signed URLs, MIME validation, malware scan later |
| Webhooks | Signature verification, idempotency, replay window |
| Audit | Append-only audit for auth, permissions, attendance corrections, payments, AI actions |

The current web auth context supports Hono cookie auth but still supports Python/Rust bearer tokens
stored in localStorage. Before production, standardize on cookie/BFF style auth for the web and
SecureStore-backed sessions for mobile.

### Privacy And Compliance

Build for these obligations even before formal legal review:

- Data minimization: collect only what is required for school operations.
- Purpose limitation: student data is used for the school service, not advertising.
- Parental/school consent tracking for minors.
- Guardian access controls: guardians only see linked students.
- Location privacy: short retention for bus GPS samples.
- Biometric caution: face recognition should be optional, consented, region-aware, and off by
  default. Avoid it in the MVP unless a pilot specifically requires it.
- Export/delete workflows for legal requests.
- Vendor registry for WhatsApp/SMS/email/payment/AI processors.
- Regional data residency option later for enterprise deals.

### AI Safety

Rules:

- AI cannot silently mark students risky without evidence and human-visible reason codes.
- AI cannot send high-impact parent messages without review unless it is a pre-approved template
  filled with deterministic facts.
- AI cannot make payment, discipline, enrollment, or exclusion decisions.
- Every AI output used in the product stores prompt version, model, input references, output, and
  reviewer decision where applicable.
- RAG answers must be tenant-scoped and cite internal sources.
- Prompt injection tests become part of evals for parent chatbot and admin assistant.

## Observability And Operations

Use OpenTelemetry for traces, metrics, and logs once services move beyond simple local development.

Minimum telemetry:

- Request count, latency, and error rate by route.
- DB query latency by module.
- Outbox queue depth and retry count.
- Notification send latency, provider status, and delivery success.
- Attendance scan latency.
- Payment webhook processing time and duplicate count.
- AI cost, latency, refusal/error rate, approval rate, and edit rate.
- Tenant-level rate limit events.

Operational targets for the attendance MVP:

| Flow | Target |
| --- | --- |
| QR scan API response | p95 under 300 ms inside target region |
| Parent alert enqueue | under 1 second after scan commit |
| Parent alert delivery to provider | p95 under 5 seconds, provider dependent |
| Principal dashboard update | under 2 seconds |
| Outbox event loss | zero, verified by retry/idempotency |

Backups:

- Postgres point-in-time recovery.
- Daily logical backup drill.
- Object storage versioning for important generated documents.
- Restore test before production pilots.

## Naming Conventions

### Database

- Table names: `snake_case`, plural nouns.
- Columns: `snake_case`.
- Foreign keys: `<entity>_id`.
- Join tables: `<left>_<right>` or domain phrase such as `student_guardians`.
- Enum values: lowercase snake case in product docs; map to ORM enum style as needed.
- Indexes: `idx_<table>_<columns>`.
- Unique constraints: `uniq_<table>_<columns>`.

### API

- Paths: lowercase kebab-case or simple plural nouns.
- JSON fields: camelCase.
- Route resources: plural nouns.
- Commands: verb suffix routes only when not plain CRUD, for example `/approve`, `/generate`.
- Error codes: uppercase snake case, for example `AUTH_TOKEN_NOT_FOUND`.

### TypeScript

- Components: PascalCase file and export names.
- Hooks: `useThing`.
- Services: `ThingService`.
- Repositories: `ThingRepository`.
- Validators: `thing.validator.ts`.
- Policies: `thing.policy.ts`.
- Events: `thing.events.ts`.
- Tests: colocated `*.test.ts`.

Recommended module layout:

```text
apps/hono-api/src/modules/attendance
+-- attendance.routes.ts
+-- attendance.controller.ts
+-- attendance.service.ts
+-- attendance.repository.ts
+-- attendance.validator.ts
+-- attendance.policy.ts
+-- attendance.events.ts
+-- attendance.test.ts
```

Shared packages to add when implementation starts:

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@school-os/contracts` | Shared API/event DTO types and schemas |
| `@school-os/authz` | Permission constants and policy helpers |
| `@school-os/events` | Event envelope, outbox helpers, event names |
| `@school-os/config` | Typed environment/config helpers |
| `@school-os/id` | Standard ID generation |

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Primary database | Postgres |
| MySQL | Integration/import target only, not core product DB |
| Cache | Redis cache-aside plus rate limits, locks, and lightweight queues |
| Kafka | Not MVP; add after outbox/worker is insufficient |
| API framework | Hono for primary product API |
| Python/FastAPI | Use later for AI/ML service, not core CRUD |
| Rust | Use later for high-throughput edge scanner/realtime/infra work if needed |
| Vector search | pgvector first |
| AI orchestration | Server-owned orchestration with typed tools, guardrails, approvals, evals |
| Auth storage web | HttpOnly cookies/BFF style |
| Auth storage mobile | SecureStore-backed session handles |
| Tenancy | Shared tables with `tenant_id`, policy layer, and RLS on sensitive tables |
| Service style | Modular monolith first, microservices later |

## Open Decisions Before Implementation

1. Standard ID format: migrate from current string CUID-style IDs to UUIDv7, or standardize CUID2
   text IDs across all services.
2. WhatsApp provider: Meta WhatsApp Cloud API directly, Twilio, or a regional BSP.
3. Payment provider priority by market: Stripe, Razorpay, Paymob, Flutterwave, or local PSPs.
4. AI provider policy: OpenAI first with abstraction, or provider-neutral from day one.
5. Biometric attendance: explicitly out of MVP unless consent/legal review and a pilot demand it.
6. Data residency target for first market.
7. Whether to put generated report cards in object storage only or also store normalized snapshots.
