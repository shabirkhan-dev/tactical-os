# Browser UI test (School OS web)

## When to use

After changing anything user-visible or interactive in `apps/web` or `packages/ui`:

- Dropdowns, menus, tooltips, dialogs, sheets
- Theme / motion controls
- Forms, auth gates, admin chrome
- Reports of “clicking X crashes the app”

Do **not** stop at typecheck alone for these changes.

## Preferred path: Playwright MCP

Project MCP (`.cursor/mcp.json`) includes `playwright` (`@playwright/mcp`).

1. Ensure web is running (`bun run dev` or `bun --cwd apps/web run dev`). Default local URL: `http://localhost:3000` (e2e config uses `:3005`).
2. Call `GetMcpTools` for server `playwright`, then use tools to:
   - navigate to the affected route
   - `browser_snapshot` (accessibility tree — primary signal)
   - click / type the interaction that previously failed
   - snapshot again; watch for blank page, error overlay, or missing controls
3. If the page shows a Next.js / React error overlay, capture the message and fix the root cause before finishing.

## Regression path: repo Playwright e2e

```bash
bun run test:e2e:web
```

- Config: `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` (baseURL `http://127.0.0.1:3005`)
- Specs: `apps/web/e2e/`
- Add a focused spec when a bug is fixed and should not return (e.g. theme animation menu opens and selects an option without page crash).

## Base UI / shadcn composition traps (common crash sources)

These throw at runtime when composition is wrong — typecheck will not catch them:

| Part | Must be inside |
|------|----------------|
| `DropdownMenuLabel` | `DropdownMenuGroup` **or** `DropdownMenuRadioGroup` |
| `DropdownMenuItem` / checkbox / radio items | Group or RadioGroup as documented |
| `SelectLabel` / `SelectItem` | `SelectGroup` |

Error looks like: `MenuGroupContext is missing. Menu group parts must be used within <Menu.Group> or <Menu.RadioGroup>.`

Also avoid wrapping a **menu / dropdown trigger** inside a **Tooltip trigger** — focus and pointer ownership conflict. Put tooltips on simple icon buttons only.

## Logic vs UI checks

- **UI/UX**: open → interact → close; keyboard focus; dark/light; mobile width if layout-sensitive.
- **Logic**: assert state change (URL, localStorage key, visible label, network) via snapshot text or e2e `expect`, not screenshots alone.

## Done criteria

- Interaction that was broken no longer throws or unmounts the tree
- Lint / typecheck clean for touched packages
- For crash fixes: either MCP walkthrough noted in the reply, or a small e2e covering the path
